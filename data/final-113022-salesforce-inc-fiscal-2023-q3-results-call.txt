Marc Benioff  
 
Okay well thank you so much Mike, and thank you everyone for being on the call.  
 
I just want to come back to how great it was to see so many of you at Dreamforce in September. It was 
really a wonderful experience for me personally, it was our most successful, but I really think it was our 
most important Dreamforce ever, because we were able to come together for what we called our great 
reunion, and being with you all of you, especially at our IR day, that was a joy for me.  
 
Now let's get on to the quarter results. We delivered solid revenue growth and profitability in an 
increasingly challenging environment. You've se en how we're driving customer success, the strength of 
our organic innovation, and this incredible Trailblazer community and how it manifested at the 
Dreamforce. Everywhere we turned, we saw customers learning how to connect with their customers in 
entirel y new ways, and the depth of our Customer 360 platform.  
 
We're also thrilled to introduce Genie, which is our customer data cloud. It's one of the most 
transformational technologies we have ever delivered, and when you hear some of the metrics already 
comi ng out of customer adoption with Genie, I think that you'll be incredibly impressed, and I can't wait for 
Bret to talk about that.  
 
The best part of Dreamforce was being together. That was what it was all about for me, and I'm sure it 
was for you as well, and the 40,000 folks that all came to San Francisco to have this incredible 
experience, and all the additional folks that joined us online.  
 
Now let's get to our results.  
 
Revenue in the quarter, well, it was $7.84 billion, that's up 14% year over year, I  think that's a record for 
us. Also, it was 19% in constant currency. We're going to talk about that foreign exchange situation in just 
a second.

  Salesforce Inc. – Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Results Conference Call , November 30, 2022  
We closed some amazing deals in the quarter, with great companies like Bank of America and RBC 
Wealth Managem ent and Dell and other great stories, and I'm also going to get that into a moment as 
well. Even with purchase decisions receiving greater scrutiny, we continue to gain market share and close 
marquee transactions. IDC recently ranked Salesforce as the numb er one in CRM, and now we've done 
that for nine years in a row.  
 
I'm proud that we've delivered revenue growth in this environment, but especially proud of the team for 
our continued focus on delivering record operating margins. Here you can see now up 22 .7% non -GAAP 
operating margin we delivered for the quarter, and I think, when I look back at various financial crises, we 
think back even, I think, to ’08 , ’09, I think it was like somewhere down in 10%. So we've come a long way 
in a short period of time.  
 
This quarter's been further proof of our commitment to profitable growth, continuing our operating margin 
growth, continued focus on our revenue growth, continued focus on our market share growth, and a great 
evidence of that is our remaining performance obligation. Our RPO is now an incredible $40 billion.  
 
Now, as I've said in the last few quarters, the dollar had a strong quarter, maybe even a stronger quarter 
than we had. I think that when we first said that, in the second quarter, folks didn't really understand what 
we were talking about; or maybe it was in the first quarter we said that. I remember it was a trip to Japan 
when I called Amy, and I was asking her what the expectations were for revenue. But when I told her 
what my guidance was for what an d how I was looking at revenue, including foreign exchange, I don't 
think either one of us could believe what was really happening, and now we've really seen it start to play 
out. We continue to see the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and of cours e that is our biggest 
surprise of the year. In the quarter, we saw $300 million year -over-year headwinds to revenue, and we've 
expected a total of $900 million for the full year. Now , that is something we just could not have expected a 
year ago, and that i s when we initiated our revenue guidance.  
 
At Dreamforce and in my travels around the world, our customers have been asking how to best navigate 
this economic situation, with the high level of market volatility and uncertainty. A lot of CEOs have never 
been through these types of crises before, they haven't seen these kind of variations in the market , or in 
foreign exchange , or even in market demand. Well, we've got a lot to say about that, because this is not 
our first financial crisis. I'm seeing a lot of  buying behavior that really reflects a lot of what we've seen 
during other crises, whether it was ’08 , ’09, or even ’01. Obviously the current economic situation is 
nowhere near as severe as what happened beginning in ’08, but there are some patterns that  we've seen 
repeat themselves. In early ’08, we saw customers who were reluctant to expand distribution capacity, 
they weren't adding service people, they froze their hiring, they initiated headcount reductions. We saw 
those occur that year, we saw that in  ’01 as well. I think that maybe when things start to get a little tough , 
or when the stock market shifts, that's when CEOs say hold on, should we be expanding distribution 
capacity right now? Should we be expanding service capacity? Let's stop our adverti sing, let's stop our 
marketing spend; things that they can immediately take actions on. Well, you couple that with foreign 
exchange headwinds have become an issue and everyone was shifting their focus to finding efficiencies, 
reducing their costs, increasi ng productivity, and again we're feeling all of this once again.  
 
That led us to the shift of the Company. It took us a lot to how we operate and where we are investing our 
dollars. We've actually developed our own playbook. We really wrote it all down, we  talked about what 
was happening, we knew it would happen again. We had to dust off some of those plans and numbers 
from 12 , 13 years ago, from 22 years ago, and we've turned that playbook into gaining market share and 
focusing on operational discipline an d operational excellence, especially in the face of economic 
headwinds. As the economy has started to recover, whether it's in 2010 or even in 2002, we were able to 
radically accelerate our growth.

  Salesforce Inc. – Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Results Conference Call , November 30, 2022  
I have to tell you, when we went back as a team and we lo oked at the numbers, even I was really 
shocked to see kind of how things changed, some of the decisions that we made, but then how we all of a 
sudden were able to navigate so well and use that as an opportunity to adjust the Company in a number 
of really c ritical and strategic areas.  
 
Now, I've always believed, since that point especially, that an economic crisis creates these opportunities, 
and we're squarely in that moment, and we've acted.  
 
Starting in July of this year, the buying environment became mo re measured, and foreign exchange 
headwinds were becoming increasingly complex. We told you then we didn't believe this challenging 
macro environment was going to be a short -term problem. You know we're not economists. You know 
that we don't know exactly w hat is happening or when the recovery will happen, etc., but we do see a lot, 
and I think we understand a lot about what's going on, because we have such strong global data.  
 
And we're not assuming that this economy gets any better anytime soon. We're just  reporting what we 
see with our customers, the kind of changes they make when they start to feel these headwinds. We're 
following our playbook to make sure we're well positioned to gain market share, to increase our 
profitability, to focus on our operating  margin, to focus on the growth of our revenue, and be able to 
continue to invest , especially when the economy recovers.  
 
Now for this fiscal year, we're maintaining our revenue guidance of $30.9 billion to $31 billion, up 17% 
year over year , or 20% in con stant currency, and you saw that that also included that incremental foreign 
exchange headwind, and it's even an expected incremental $100 million of foreign exchange headwind 
just since last quarter.  
 
We're raising our Fiscal Year ‘ 23 non -GAAP operating margin guidance from 20.4% to 20.7%, an 
expansion of 200 basis points year over year, and I expect a lot more, especially with this increased focus 
we have on expanding our operating margin.  
 
Salesforce is mission -critical to nearly every Fortune 1000 comp any, because every company is 
becoming a customer company. And everyone knows that this is the time, during a crisis like this, that you 
need to focus on your customers. If you need to do one thing, if there's one critical thing that every 
company has to d o to get through this, it's to make sure they maintain their relationships with their 
customers. It's a critical part of navigating through this time, and you're not going to be successful if you 
don't stay connected with your customers.  
 
We're signing tra nsformational deals with major brands, as every industry continues to digitally transform, 
and that continues to be perhaps the most important initiative of every company, regardless of the 
economic situation. When you look at this by industry, it's slight ly different for each industry. In telecom, 
we're working with almost every major player as they transform how they connect with their customers. All 
telcos must deliver faster better service to customers, keeping their costs down, focusing on their NPS 
scores, becoming more competitive, we all know that. It's a highly competitive industry, we all understand 
the dynamics well, it's one of the reasons why we've done so well in all these global telecom companies.  
 
But I really want to talk to you about a gre at example and this deal that we signed with T -Mobile in the 
quarter. Now we've done a lot of work with Mike and with T -Mobile over the years, and it's been very 
exciting to see how they built their company, and especially how they've executed the merger, and now 
they have a tremazing (phon) transformational opportunity on how they work with businesses. We're 
working with them to develop a vision for the next -generation user experience for T -Mobile for Business, 
and our professional services team is leading  that charge.

Financial services, well, that's another industry that's been going through one of the most incredible digital 
transformations, but it's an incredible moment for them actually, in this crisis. It's why we're working with 
all the major finan cial service companies to drive stronger client relationships and unite their teams to be 
more effective, especially in this environment. It's a golden time for financial services in many ways. A 
great example is Bank of America, who I think has been a cus tomer for more than 20 years, and we've 
been with them through many different financial crises. But in a short amount of time, they've increased 
productivity and reduced their technical debt. They're saving time and money, they're connecting with 
their cus tomers in new ways. It's a tremendous relationship with BofA, to become their CRM standard. 
We're delighted to have such great success with them over many decades, and to expand this 
relationship to the business bank, the corporate bank, and the investment  bank. It's really an expansion, 
and I just want to thank Brian for his tremendous loyalty , but also his partnership , over so many decades, 
and it's just a great organization to work with every single day.  
 
Well, before I go on, first of all I want to give  you an invitation. I hope that you'll all plan to join us in New 
York City next week, where we're going to host our Salesforce world tour on December 8. Join us in 
person or online, where we're going to announce some new innovations, and you're going to h ear from 
our incredible customers and so much more.  
 
Now. Before I end, I have to say something, and it's something that I did not want to say ever, and I'm 
extremely sad to tell you that Bret Taylor is going to be leaving the Company. Bret and I are like brothers. 
I love him very deeply. He's an incredible person. One of the great joys of my Company has been having 
him here. And I'll tell you, for me, this has been a feeling of tremendous loss, I'm experiencing that right 
now, you can probably hear it in m y voice. It makes me think of all the great people that we have actually 
lost in the Company over the time as well, so many great leaders of our industry, but especially now with 
Bret, this is just really hard for me, and I'm extremely sad to see him go. I  know he has created two great 
companies, I know he wants to go create a third great company, and you can't keep a wild tiger in a cage. 
We got to let them be free and let him go, and I understand, but I don't like it.  
 
Bret, you know that you're always g oing to be our brother, you know that we love you very deeply, that 
you have a home here. We're going to try to get you back somehow. So don't think that you're going to 
somehow get out of this alive, because you're not. You're always going to be part of o ur Ohana. We are 
really upset about this, and it's going to be a difficult moment for us, but I know that you're going to be 
with us through the end of the year, and I know you're going to continue to work with us even after this 
point, but Bret, we love y ou, and we're so sorry to see you leave the Company at the end of this year.  
 
Bret Taylor  
 
Thank you Marc. It's hard to follow that, and trying to keep my composure as well. I just want to start, 
Marc, by just expressing how deeply grateful I am to you and , just as importantly, the entire Salesforce 
team, for the past six -plus years. I just couldn't have imagined it when I joined the Company. I could not 
be more proud of the trust, innovation and customer success we've delivered in my time here, particularl y 
over the past few years. I think this amazing community has helped every organization in the world to 
remain connected to their customers amidst a public health crisis, economic turmoil, this global pandemic, 
it's just incredible and I'm incredibly grate ful. 
 
Marc, you personally, you've been my mentor long before I joined this Company, and in the past six 
years, your relationship has definitely become the most significant in my professional career. I would not 
be the leader I am today without you, and I cannot thank you enough for our friendship and our 
partnership.  
 
The past few years have been tumultuous for all of us, and I've recently been reflecting what's been truly 
important to me. While there is absolutely no easy time for a transition like this, I really do feel that now is

the right time for me to return to my entrepreneurial roots, particularly given the technology landscape and 
the economy going through such tectonic shifts.  
 
Salesforce has never been stronger, and I've never been more confiden t in the future of the Company. As 
Marc said, I will remain as Co-CEO through the end of the fiscal year, not only to ensure a smooth 
transition but, most importantly, to ensure that we have a strong close to the quarter and a strong close to 
the fiscal ye ar. As Marc said, even after this transition, I will always, always be a part of this Company and 
always be a part of this community.  
 
As Marc said, we had a solid quarter, double -digit top - and bottom -line performance, demonstrating the 
strength of our bu siness model and our commitment to operating with discipline and delivering profitable 
growth at scale. We continue to deliver on organic innovation, and our product portfolio is strategically 
positioned, mission -critical, and highly differentiated. Our ec osystem and our app exchange marketplace 
are unparalleled in the industry. As Marc mentioned, as you saw at Dreamforce, our innovation engine is 
in overdrive, with Genie, Slack Canvas, Net Zero Marketplace and more, building on our position as a 
leader in nearly every CRM category.  
 
Genie, in particular, makes every part of our Customer 360 platform more automated, intelligent , and 
real-time, driving faster time to value for our customers. The adoption of Genie by our customers, 
particularly this past Cybe r Week, has exceeded all of our expectations. The Genie Customer Data Cloud 
is already processing literally over 100 billion customer records on average every single day. During 
Cyber Week alone, Genie ingested an astonishing 1.1 trillion records and enabl ed 43 billion consumer 
engagements for our customers.  Inter, a leading digital banking service company in Brazil, is a great 
example of Genie's power. Inter was able to consolidate six data systems into one, and they are 
converting 35 times more customers with Genie.  
 
Like Marc, I met with hundreds of CEOs across every industry over the last few months. In this buying 
environment, our customers are increasingly focused on three things. First is time to value: our customers 
need to quickly get the benefits of their technology investments. Second is ensuring these digital 
transformation projects drive cost savings, in addition to customer satisfaction and top -line growth. Third, 
we know our customers need to consolidate their platforms and vendor relationship s to reduce complexity 
and risk and to drive efficiency.  
 
We are delivering on all three at scale today for our customers.  Our customers are seeing on average an 
estimated 25% in savings in their IT costs and 26% increase in employee productivity using Sa lesforce, 
according to a recent survey of more than 3 ,500 of our customers. RBC Wealth Management is a great 
example. RBC is onboarding new customers in minutes instead of days, and they've consolidated over 26 
technology systems into one using our Custome r 360 platform, decreasing their maintenance costs by 
50%.  
 
Despite the economic headwinds that Marc mentioned, we had record low revenue attrition again this 
quarter, which is a testament to just how mission -critical Salesforce is to our customers, especi ally in this 
environment.  
 
We also launched new product bundles for sales, service, marketing and analytics. These product 
bundles are enabling our customers to consolidate their tools on Salesforce, driving efficient growth. 
We're also closing transformat ional deals and multi -cloud expansions. This quarter, seven of our top ten 
deals included five or more of our clouds.  
 
Now let's turn to the cloud performance. Sales Cloud, our flagship, continues to drive sales productivity 
for the world's most important brands. Sales Cloud grew 12% year over year, a healthy 17% in constant 
currency, including great customer wins at companies like Bolt, Snowflake , and Thermo Fisher. Service

Cloud continues to help our customers deliver exceptional customer service experien ces and reduce their 
customer service costs. Service Cloud grew 12% year over year , or 16% in constant currency, 
approaching $2 billion in revenue for the quarter, with wins at Carl Zeiss, Dell , and Fujitsu. Our Marketing 
and Commerce Clouds power the digi tal customer experiences for the world's greatest retailers and 
brands around the world, and together grew 12% year over year , or 18% in constant currency, thanks to 
wins at companies like Banco Bradesco, Hugo Boss , and Slack.  
 
We just passed Black Friday and Cyber Monday. I want to express my gratitude to our engineering 
teams. Our engineering teams again delivered unparalleled mission -critical reliability and scale to retailers 
around the world. Even lapping the pandemic, the sales process for our Commerc e Cloud in Cyber Week 
increased 11% year over year, and our Marketing Cloud delivered nearly 49 billion messages in Cyber 
Week alone, up 21% year over year. We've now sent 1.4 trillion messages from our Marketing Cloud so 
far this year. Just incredible.  
 
Our platform business, which includes Slack, grew 18%, or 22% in constant currency, highlighted by wins 
at Japan Airlines, WorkSafe Victoria, and Zoom. Einstein Artificial Intelligence platform is now generating 
194 billion predictions every single day acro ss the Salesforce Customer 360 platform, up 57% year over 
year.  
 
Slack, which now powers collaboration and workflows across the entire Customer 360, grew 46% year 
over year. Slack is now handling more than 2.6 billion actions every single day, and had gre at wins this 
quarter with companies like Rivian and Verizon.  
 
Data, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau, continues to be core to every digital transformation at every 
single one of our customers. Data grew 13% year over year, or 16% in constant currency. We're seeing 
strong demand for MuleSoft, which re -accelerated in the quarter to 19% year -over-year growth , or 23% in 
constant currency, with wins at brands like Western Union, SmileDirectClub , and Kona. Integration 
transactions on the MuleSoft platform gre w to $6.7 billion per day, up 33% year over year. Tableau grew 
at 8% year over year , or 9% in constant currency, with wins in the quarter at Inter and McLaren Racing.  
As a reminder, due to the way we recognize revenue in MuleSoft and Tableau, when the macr o 
environment is difficult , we typically see the effects earlier and more pronounced in these businesses.  
 
We're confident in the opportunity ahead for Tableau, and we recently made changes to re -accelerate 
Tableau growth. This includes new leadership and , as importantly, new product integrations like Revenue 
Intelligence, a deep integration between Sales Cloud and Tableau that has become one of our 
fastest -growing add -on products.  
 
Finally, as we mentioned every quarter, our industry solutions continue to  be a strength in our portfolio, 
with out -of-the-box processes that enable our customers to achieve faster time to value and lower 
implementation costs.  
 
Even with the many successes in the quarter, we expect this increasingly challenging buying environme nt 
to continue next year. I'm confident that Salesforce has never been more mission -critical to our customers 
in this environment.  
 
To wrap, I'm so grateful for our employees, our 18 million Trailblazers, and all of our customers and 
partners for helping l ead the way with innovation, agility and resilience to navigate in these times.  
 
Before I pass it to you, Amy, I just want to express my personal gratitude to you. As I became a first -time 
CEO and you became a first -time CFO, navigating the Company and nav igating our customers through 
these crises, I'm so grateful for our relationship and for everything this Company has done for me.

  Salesforce Inc. – Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Results Conference Call , November 30, 2022  
Amy Weaver  
 
Great. Bret, thank you so much. Let me just start by saying to you, it has truly been a joy to work with you 
through the last six years. I am going to miss you terribly, but I'm also equally excited for you on your next 
steps, and I know they will be incredible success again.  
 
Taking a sharp left turn to our results here, I am pleased to report another quarter of dou ble-digit top - and 
bottom -line growth. Despite increasing macro pressure, revenue grew nearly 20% in constant currency. 
And, as we discussed at our Investor Day in September, it's a new day for profitability. I'm very proud of 
our Salesforce team and all o f our employees for generating record operating margin during Q3.  
 
Reiterating Marc's comments, profitable growth is a major focus as we lean in on best -in-class operational 
excellence across all aspects of our business. As customers focus on optimizing ti me to value, driving 
cost savings, and consolidating platforms and vendor relationships, we remain well positioned to support 
them through the current economic environment.  
 
Now to our results for Q3 Fiscal Year  2023. I'll begin with top -line commentary. T otal revenue for the third 
quarter was $7.84 billion, up 14% year over year, or 19% in constant currency. Foreign exchange 
continued to be a headwind to our results, as the dollar further strengthened throughout the quarter. For 
Q3, the total FX impact was  $300 million, approximately $50 million more than we had forecast.  
 
A few highlights from the quarter. Again, as we outlined at Investor Day, we have three balanced growth 
pillars: Customer 360 Advantage, industry solutions, and geographical expansion. Al l of these continue to 
reflect the growing adoption of our portfolio across our customer base.  
 
First, multi -cloud adoption by our customer base continues. Customers with five or more clouds increased 
ARR by over 20%. Second, our industry solution continu es to be a strong tailwind to our revenue growth. 
Seven of our 13 industry clouds grew ARR above 50% this quarter. Some of the highest -performing 
industries' clouds in the quarter included energy and utilities, manufacturing, and our recently announced 
Automotive Cloud.  Finally, from a geographical perspective, Americas grew 16% year over year, EMEA 
grew 10%, 23% in constant currency, and APAC grew 14%, which is 30% in constant currency. As you 
have heard, revenue attrition in Q3 was again below 7.5%, refle cting the value that our services are 
providing to the customer base in this tough operating environment.  
 
Q3 non -GAAP operating margin was a strong 22.7%, driven by our ongoing focus on disciplined 
execution, our hiring slowdown, and resource prioritizati on. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.21 and non -GAAP 
EPS was $1.40. Mark -to-market accounting of the Company's strategic investments increased GAAP and 
non-GAAP EPS by $0.02.  
 
Operating cash flow was $313 million in Q3, down 23% year over year. Capex  was $198 million, r esulting 
in free cash flow of $115 million, down 52% year over year, both driven by lower billings.  
 
Turning to remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract. RPO 
ended Q3 at approximately $40 billion, up 10% year ove r year. Current remaining performance obligation, 
or CRPO, was approximately $20.9 billion, up 11% year over year and 15% in constant currency. This 
includes one point of incremental FX headwinds beyond our Q3 guidance.  
 
And, finally, Q3 was a milestone qu arter for Salesforce. After announcing our first -ever share repurchase 
program on the last earnings call, I am pleased to share that we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders 
during Q3.

  Salesforce Inc. – Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Results Conference Call , November 30, 2022  
Before moving to our guidance, I'd like to comment on the current econ omic environment. Recall that last 
quarter we noted measured customer buying behavior, really beginning in July. This led to elongated 
sales cycles, additional deal approval layers , and deal compression, particularly in enterprise. As Q3 
progressed, we saw  an even more challenging buying environment, driving intense customer scrutiny on 
every investment dollar to ensure the highest return possible. During Q3, this behavior was most 
pronounced in our U.S. and major European markets, while Japan remained more  resilient.  From an 
industry perspective, the most impacted were retail, consumer goods, and communications and media, 
while the more resilient were travel and hospitality, manufacturing, automotive, and energy. And, from a 
product perspective, we continue d to see customer spending pressure in commerce and marketing.  
 
Now to our guidance. First, on revenue, we are pleased to maintain our Fiscal Year ‘ 23 revenue guidance 
of $30.9 billion to $31 billion, representing 17% growth year over year, or 20% in const ant currency, 
despite an incremental $100 million FX headwind since our last call. This raises the total year -over-year 
FX headwind to $900 million. In addition, our guidance includes Slack at slightly above $1.5 billion.  
 
As you've already heard, we are d eeply committed to expanding our profitability over the long term. I am 
proud that we are raising our Fiscal ‘ 23 non -GAAP operating margin guidance to 20.7%, an increase of 
200 basis points year over year. This guidance also includes approximately 75 basis  points of headwind 
from Slack. As a reminder, because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same 
currencies, there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin.  
 
For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.25, and non -GAAP EPS of $1.35 to $1.37. For the full year, 
we expect GAAP EPS of $0.55 to $0.57, and non -GAAP EPS of $4.92 to $4.94. CRPO growth for Q4 is 
expected to be approximately 7% year over year, or 10% in constant currency. This guidance continues 
to incorporate the more challenging trends in our customer behavior, as previously discussed.  
 
We now expect our Fiscal ‘ 23 operating cash flow guidance to be approximately 16%, which is at the 
lower end of our previous guidance, driven by lower billings. This includes a three -point headwind from 
cash taxes associated with tax law changes, requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs. We now 
expect Capex  to be approximately 2.5% of revenue for the fiscal year. This results in free cash flow 
growth of approximately 17% for the  fiscal year.  
 
Before I close, I'd like to share a few thoughts on Fiscal Year ‘ 24. As discussed, we are experiencing a 
very unpredictable macro environment, as our customers are working to ensure their businesses are also 
healthy for the long term. Compou nding that dynamic is an unprecedented foreign currency market. 
Therefore, at this time, we believe it would be premature to provide revenue guidance for the next fiscal 
year.  
 
Now, in terms of operating margin, we are driving operating discipline and foll owing our playbook , that 
Marc discussed, to ensure that we are consistently expanding our operating margin in the face of top -line 
headwinds. And, as a leadership team, we're continuing to take a hard look at our cost structure. This is 
all part of our pla ybook, and we will continue to take steps that drive profitable growth.  
 
Of note, we intend to provide full FY’24 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.  
 
To close, we are helping our customers navigate the current macro environment by bringing 
much-needed efficiencies to their digital strategy, with a compelling value case. Our commitment to 
disciplined decision -making is unwavering, and we are marching towards our Fiscal ‘ 26 target of at least 
25% non -GAAP operating margin, inclusive of any capita l allocation decision. And, as our business 
grows, we will continue to target returning on average 30% to 40% of free cash flow annually to our 
shareholders.

  Salesforce Inc. – Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Results Conference Call , November 30, 2022  
Now, Mike, should we open up the call for questions?  
 
Mike Spencer  
 
Sounds good, thank you Amy.  
 
Bo, we'll go to Q&A and we'll take the first question.  
 
Operator  
 
Thank you Mr. Spencer. We take our first question this afternoon of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.  
 
Keith Weiss  
 
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the questions. Maybe one for Marc and o ne for Amy.  
 
Marc, on the leadership change or Bret leaving, we're also very sorry to see Bret leaving. He was a great 
addition to the team. I guess the good news is there's already a CEO, in you, set to go. But should we 
expect a replacement for Bret on a going -forward basis? Are you going to look to go back to that kind of 
Co-CEO dynamic, or replace kind of what he was doing on a day -to-day basis with some other executive 
on a go -forward basis?  
 
Then I guess for Amy, at the Analyst Day, you talked about a more back -end-loaded operating margin 
trajectory towards that 25%. Any change in that dynamic, given kind of what's going on in the macro 
environment, and seeing kind of the degradation on the top line? Does that push operating margin? Does 
that sort of push operating margin expansion to kind of the forefront in any way?  
 
Marc Benioff  
 
Well thanks Keith, and I think it's a great question, and obviously we're still in a little bit of shock and 
extremely sad, and feeling a lot of loss for losing Bret. Again , I don't have to tell you, one of the best 
people I've ever worked with in my life and also just a great person.  
 
I have to also tell you that we have a lot of fantastic people in the Company. Bret's management team, 
what we call the ELT here at Salesfor ce, includes some incredible people who have been with us in some 
cases for decades. They're some of our most capable and incredible people. I think you know a lot of 
them Keith, very well, and on a personal level as well, and I have to tell you, I couldn' t be more proud of 
Bret and everything he's done in the last seven years .  
 
But while we have a huge light on Bret, I think it would be unfair to not also put a huge light on these other 
managers and leaders in the Company who have done such a great job, w hether it's our product leaders, 
our operational leaders, geographic leaders, many of them who you know and have met over the years, 
whether it was at Dreamforces or World Tours or at Investor Days, whether it is people who do our impact 
work or philanthro py work or human resources, our incredible marketing leaders, many of whom we have 
such deep personal relationships with, because we've done such unbelievable marketing in the Company 
now for so long; folks who have joined us after acquiring their companie s, and we have many of those 
folks as well, and which is also how we ended up with Bret when we bought his company; and people 
who are doing core work in our areas, like the quality and sustainability, as well as operational leaders, 
where we've brought in  some great new folks recently from organizations who are bringing us a new level 
of operational excellence. I don't have to tell you, I think we have the finest engineering team in the world, 
the leaders in engineering, and some of them are what we call b oomerangs, people left and didn't find 
greener pastures, and came back to reclaim their leadership positions in the Company, are probably the

greatest. I don't have to call out my co -founder, who you know very well, Parker Harris, who happens to 
be in Toky o today and not on the call , because he's running our world tour with our phenomenal team 
there, who's delivered what I expect to be shortly the second largest software company in Japan; and on 
and on and on.  
 
But I do want to bring it back to Bret, becau se this is his moment, and I think it's very important that we 
really send him the appropriate gratitude and also call out. Until he walks out the door, don't worry, I'm 
trying to keep recruiting him back, and I am a good salesman, Keith, as you know me ve ry well, and the 
deal is not over until it's over, but we do have to tell you that he has decided to leave, but I tell people all 
the time, we lose deals all the time, Keith, and for me, I never lose. I keep going back until I win.  
 
Brian is here laughing . Brian, how long have you been with the Company now?  
 
Brian Millham  
 
Twenty -three years.  
 
Marc Benioff  
 
Twenty -three years. Is that true, Brian?  
 
Brian Millham  
 
Yes, it’s true.  
 
Marc Benioff  
 
Do you feel like I'm going to keep at this?  
 
Brian Millham  
 
Yes, you will.  
 
Marc Benioff  
 
Yes. I'll break him down, when I (inaudible) . So he's in trouble.  
 
All right. Amy?  
 
Amy Weaver  
 
Okay Keith, turning over to operating margin.  
 
As I mentioned, we are very committed to being at 25% or above by FY’26. Now, we're not giving a guide 
for FY’24 at this moment, so I'm not going to comment on the linearity. I will say that this is just a huge 
focus for the entire Company. I think we've really shown that with our current quarter at 22.7%, which is 
an all -time record high . This is coming not just from one area or one silver bullet, but really from a 
commitment and a disciplined approach across all parts of the Company, whether it is sales, G&A, 
marketing, finance; the list goes on as the groups were contributing.  
 
One thin g that we're particularly focused on are structural changes. So, we've certainly driven down 
workforce costs by the much more measured approach to hiring that we have had this year. We also look

to our cost of goods sold infra (phon) third -party cost effic iencies. We tightly prioritized T&A this year, to 
prioritize customer -facing travel, and we are also benefiting from choices that we have made in the past 
and continue to review around our real estate footprint.  
 
Again , the commitment is here, I'm excited  to see where we can go, and I think we're already putting the 
necessary tools in place.  
 
Operator  
 
Thank you. We take our next question now from Mark Murphy of J .P.Morgan.  
 
Mark Murphy  
 
Thank you very much. Bret, happy trails, and thanks for everything.  
 
Marc, I wanted to ask you if you think that this volatile environment is going to be fully conducive to 
remote work, or do you see some of your employees maybe gravitating back a little more to in -office?  
 
Amy, relatedly and since you just mentioned it, could you touch on the plans for the real estate footprint, 
including the Salesforce Tower and the other buildings, and just help us understand maybe how that 
could contribute to margin expansion?  
 
Marc Benioff  
 
Absolutely. First, Mark, I hope that you see  that the operating margin in this quarter, which has hit a 
record level at 22.7%, that we are fulfilling our commitment to you and to others, that we are deeply 
focused on this. You're 100% right, that there's a lot of things pre  pandemic that we had in o ur Company 
that are expenses that we don't need post  pandemic.  
 
Now, in regards to being in the office, well, all of us are in the office today. There are no remote workers 
here. It's an interesting metaphor, but there's companies that I work with very clo sely, and I have to tell 
you, someone who's influenced me greatly is the CEO of Honeywell, Darius, and share common Board 
member Robin Washington. He's made a plea for me for many years that he has factory workers, and 
those factory workers still every sin gle day during the pandemic were in the factory, and that it's a very 
critical part of how he runs his business. When I have advocated for new kinds of work and folks having 
the flexibility in their working environment, to remember his factory workers, and  I think he's absolutely 
right and 100% correct. Well, I would also say we have factory workers. Now today, we are the factory 
workers. The work that we're doing is required here in our factory. You know where that factory is very 
well, Mark, you know wher e we are. And we have different factories around the world that we call our 
towers and our hubs and core offices. But I think we also realize, and I think that even Darius would agree 
with me, that the percentage of folks who are working remotely is going to be higher.  
 
Before  the pandemic , the percentage of remote workers for Salesforce was approximately 20%. For other 
companies now, we're seeing that normalize at somewhere around 50%, even with mandatory workdays. 
So I do think that we're going to have a  rebalancing. I think, even at Salesforce, we have what I would call 
factory jobs, folks that are required to be here, whether they're doing maybe very core work, or even new 
folks who don't have maybe the tribal knowledge yet or need the mentorship, or fo lks coming in from 
college who benefit from being in the office.  
 
But we're never going back to how it was, we all know that ; I'm sure a lot of you actually are at home right 
now.  Before this, even maybe your companies, especially the banks, especially th e New York banks, and 
some of those New York bank leaders who have made impassioned pleas for return to work ; but even

though many of you who belong to some of those banks, I bet you're not at those offices right now . And I 
think we are in a new world, and  we all realize that.  
 
But I think that we're finding a new way forward, and there will be more in office, and there will be —but 
we'll maintain the flexibility to be at home, and I will call out one more thing , which is probably one of the 
most successful  things we've done is come up with new ways to work, and you've probably been down to 
the Salesforce Ranch, and we'll have about 10,000 of our employees go through that this year in training 
and collaboration sessions, and we'll find other new ways to work , and that's also one of the reasons why 
we acquired Slack, and I think why we've seen just great growth in Slack, why Slack channels are so 
important, why you saw the tremendous new multimedia environment in Slack, and we have got quite a 
few other surpri ses coming in regards to the integration between Slack and Customer 360 and line of 
business capabilities and other areas, regarding systems of record involving Slack, and all of that's 
because we're in a new way to work, and we're going to need new tools.  
 
That’s  how I look at it Marc, I'm trying to be straight, honest with you, that you have to have a beginner's 
mind, and we're finding our way through this, and we're going to have more in work in the office, but we're 
never going to go back to how it was.   
 
Brian, do you want to talk about what you're doing with the organization?  
 
Brian Millham  
 
Yes Marc, I appreciate it, and certainly don't want to contradict anything that you said, but…  
 
Marc Benioff  
 
Oh, go ahead, Brian. Why should today be any differen t? 
 
Brian Millham  
 
Yes, a greed.  
 
Marc, I really believe that being together drives more learning, better collaboration, better networking, and 
better enablement. We have a broad portfolio of products, and we saw through the pandemic that there's 
a lot to learn around the way that we're positioning our products, new organic products coming out, 
acquisitions that we were positioning our Customer 360 to our customers. So I really like people coming 
back in the office. I like that connection that we have to on e another. I think it's part of our culture and how 
we operate. I've asked my team recently to spend more time in the office. But importantly, I've also asked 
them to spend more time in front of our customers. It's a big differentiation for us when we're o ut talking to 
our customers and driving the success that they expect from us. So I want to drive higher productivity and 
the performance culture, and one of the ways I want to do that to ensure that we're spending more time 
together, whether that's in the office , or out in front of our customers.  
 
Amy Weaver  
 
Great. So and Mark, turning to your question about how that may affect our real estate strategy and 
margins and savings going forward. So over the past two years, we have continued to re -imagine our re al 
estate strategy. That is not only to optimize for scale, but also continue hybrid work environment and how 
people are working and how they're using their space. This has included reducing our footprint fairly 
significantly. Now some of that you see when  we do large write -offs over this time, but a lot of it has also 
been opportunistic, when leases come up and we don't renew, when we consolidate into areas. It's 
something that we are continuing to benefit from. It's also something that we are continuing t o evaluate.

We have a new head of real estate, Relina Bulchandani, who is doing an incredible job along with Steve 
Breshir (phon), and really looking at every aspect of our real estate, and seeing how we use it the best 
and the most efficiently in this new  world.  
 
Mike Spencer  
 
Thanks Mark.  
 
Bo, let's go to the next question.  
 
Operator  
 
Certainly. We'll take our next question now from Raimo Lenschow at Barclays.  
 
Raimo Lenschow  
 
Great. Thank you.  
 
I just wanted to —question for Brian. As you kind of starte d alluding already on the initiatives you're taking 
there, like how should we think about what do you see in terms of what —in the field in terms of —there's 
macro, but has also relatively a decent penetration of Salesforce, like how do you think this will p lay out, 
and how do you see your Salesforce position in terms of sales capacity , etc., (audio interference ) to sell in 
this environment? Thank you.  
 
Brian Millham  
 
Thanks Raimo for the question , and really appreciate it.  
 
Certainly, the buyer environment has changed out there in the market. It's become more measured. But 
our platform is still mission -critical to every one of our customers out there, and we're seeing that play out 
in the demand environment. The pipeline that we're creating is very healthy i n the market right now. The 
interest in our customers' C360 platform remains very high. We've repositioned our products and our 
selling teams to sell not just to the CEO but to the CFO, actually across the entire C -suite. We want to 
make sure that we're co vering off everybody that could potentially say yes or no to a buying process.  
 
We're going to focus on what we can control. We have plenty of capacity in the market right now. We 
have lots of AEs that we've hired over the past couple years. We want to ma ke sure that we're doing the 
things that we can to continue to grow market share across the entire portfolio.  
 
We continue to see multi -cloud expansion. You mentioned that. We think we have a huge opportunity to 
continue to sell to our existing customers m ore of the products that are in our portfolio, both inorganic and 
the acquired companies that we have. So we still see a big opportunity for us to spend a lot of time with 
our customers, selling the entire product portfolio. The size of our selling base, t he customers that we 
have, still very big opportunity for us to expand our TAM and execute on our growth strategies.  
 
Mike Spencer  
 
Thanks Raimo.  
 
Bo, let's go to next question.

Operator  
 
Thank you. We go next now to Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank.  
 
Brad Zelnick  
 
Great, thanks so much for taking my question, and Bret, best of luck to you, it's been a pleasure.  
 
My question is for Marc. Marc, you have a lot of pressure out there from all kinds of investors to drive 
profitability, including some activists. But paradoxically, it would seem an amazing time to put money to 
work, with all the dislocation in the world creating opportunity. How do you do both at the same time?  
 
Marc Benioff  
 
Thank you Brad for the question, because I think it's probably what's on my mind every day.  
 
First, before I go to the question, I want to go back to Raimo, and Raimo, I want to tell you that our 
thoughts and prayers are with your CEO for a full recovery, and we were so sorry to hear about his 
diagnosis, and Barclays is such a n important partner of ours . But your CEO is so fantastic , and we're 
thinking of him every single moment right now.  
 
Brad, you're right. We are in a moment here where one of our goals, strong goals, as you can see by 
these results, is to increase our opera ting margin. We're not going to do anything that's going to prevent 
that increased momentum. As a shareholder myself, that's my thought every single day.  
 
We also realize we want to reduce dilution ; that's also why we're doing our stock buyback. We've tal ked 
about that extensively, it's been extremely important . I think that we bought back a considerable amount 
of stock during the quarter, that we, I think, set a goal that we're going to buy back about $10 billion, and I 
think that we have bought back an e xtensive amount, I think over $1 billion in the quarter…  
 
Amy Weaver  
 
Yes, about 11 million shares, $1.7 billion returned to shareholders.  
 
Marc Benioff  
 
I think that's extremely important as an action. Reducing dilution is very important to us, and increa sing 
our operating margin is very important to us, increasing our profitability; but this is a massive opportunity, 
you know, every company is going through a digital transformation. You and I both know very well it all 
begins and ends with the customer, a nd that's why we're closing these incredible transactions globally.  
 
At the same time, you know that there's all kinds of opportunities out there. But it has to be balanced, and 
we have to weigh those. I think some of the transactions that we were able to do in the past, when we 
were a smaller company, a more tactical company, or maybe shooting more from the hip from an 
acquisition perspective .  
 
And I think we've done, I don't know, Amy, would you say more than 60 transactions or more?  
 
Amy Weaver  
 
Yes, 60 , 70, probably , over the years.

Marc Benioff  
 
As we do even the smallest transaction to the largest, it has a different frame and a different calculation.  
 
Look, it's one of the reasons why we recruited Mike to the Company. He had the background, and you  all 
know Mike from Microsoft, because we wanted that kind of financial discipline. Amy and I talked about it 
very closely. As she came in, we spent a lot of time thinking about who we would recruit, and as we 
identified somebody who could guide us specifi cally in that area , we picked Mike, and this was important. 
We've also made other major changes to Amy's team so that she had the best A -team possible.   
 
Now, when we look at this going forward, we want to do it all. We want to continue to grow revenue, we  
want to continue to grow our operating margin, and we want to look at strategic opportunities. But we're 
not going to do that at the expense of our operating margin. We're going to continue to grow it.  
 
I think you know, at Investor Day we said that we h ave the short -term goal of 25 points, but I think that the 
reality is that we like to beat our targets. We're not going to get crazy with you on this call, but we're doing 
everything we can to make these numbers go up, and we will continue to do that in al l these areas that 
you see, and you know the Company as well as anybody, you've been inside and outside this Company, 
you know every single part of it, you know that we have lots of opportunities, lots of levers, lots of things 
that we can do. I think that  you also watched us very closely through ’08 and ’09, and you can see how 
we acted then to increase operating margin, and we are going to continue to do everything we can to 
make this the best Company possible, best numbers, and also the highest values in  the industry, and be 
an example for others as well.

Thanks Brad.  
 
Bo, let's go to the next question.  
 
Operator  
 
Certainly. We'll take that now from Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI.  
 
Kirk Materne  
 
Thanks very much. I'll add my best wishes to B ret on his next endeavors.  
 
Maybe this one's for Brian. Brian, you mentioned that the pipeline bill levels still remain healthy. I was just 
kind of curious if you could talk to us a little bit about industries that are seemingly more impacted for you 
all, due to the macro backdrop and maybe products, and kind of what's your thought process on some of 
the sales elongation that you've been seeing?  
 
I assume that you're not expecting it to change anytime in the near term, but I was just wondering if you 
could just talk to us about industries and products in particular that might be getting hit a little bit harder, 
or perhaps those that are hanging in there better than others. Thanks.  
 
Brian Millham  
 
Thanks for the question. I think, starting with the ones tha t are hanging in there better, travel and 
hospitality was a strength for us in the quarter. Our manufacturing industry really bounced back this

quarter and was very good. Automotive was very strong for us in the quarter, and energy was also quite 
strong.  
 
On the other side, we felt a little bit of pressure on our tech industry right now, and great relationships and 
big customers there, but that's an industry that we did not see acceleration in in the quarter. Some of the 
other industries were sort of flat. Financial service, as an example, was relatively flat in the quarter.  
 
One of the strengths that we did have, though, I will say, is our industry clouds. The more investment we 
make in our industry clouds, we're seeing acceleration there, very good growth  in the quarter as we invest 
in those products, we're seeing great penetration, we're seeing higher close rates. We're also seeing 
better retention rates, which is obviously very important to us as we think about the customer success of 
our base. We're abl e to get deals done faster, speaking the customer's language , and showing up with 
products that match up to their requirements very well.  
 
I'm sorry, I missed the other part of your question, if you wouldn't mind repeating it.  
 
Kirk Materne  
 
Just any prod ucts that you'd call out. We obviously see the revenue, but I was just kind of curious on a 
bookings basis…  
 
Brian Millham  
 
I think Marc mentioned earlier in his commentary about some of the products that tend to get cut early in 
a downturn, marketing spen d would be one that we see impacted fairly early on marketing automation. 
CEOs make quick action, and that's a quick place to sort of pull back , on marketing. We did see less 
expansion on sales and service in the quarter on incremental users as our custome rs started to maybe do 
a little less hiring, maybe they paused hiring, we saw less expansion on the Sales Cloud users and 
Service Cloud users. Certainly Commerce has been one where we had a great run up over the past 
couple years during the pandemic, and w e've seen a bit of a slowdown on Commerce. So those would be 
a couple of examples of some of the products that are seeing a bit of headwinds in these times.  
 
Bret Taylor  
 
Kind of interesting anecdote there around commerce. In our Commerce Cloud obviously w e had blowout 
numbers in Cyber Week, despite lapping the pandemic . But  it was interesting: commerce page views 
were up 14%, but commerce orders were only up 2%. So you can see not only our customers' impact, but 
even the consumer behaviors becoming more me asured, and we're obviously a B2B company, but all 
consumer companies are seeing this right now, and sort of doing more with less, and a lot of people 
browsing for products and buying a little bit less than they did last year, which I thought was very 
interesting.  
 
Brian Millham  
 
That’s right.  
 
Mike Spencer  
 
Great, thanks Kirk.  
 
Bo, let's take our last question now.

Operator  
 
Certainly. That last question will come from Sarah Hindlian -Bowler at Macquarie Capital.  
 
Sarah Hindlian -Bowler  
 
Great, thank you s o much, I really appreciate you squeezing me in. I'll add my congratulations and best 
wishes to you, Bret, hopeful that you have an incredible opportunity in front of you.  
 
This was a question for Amy. I think one topic that we touched on, you mentioned b riefly on the call, were 
your retention rates, which continue to be a great way to add revenue that's really high margin. So maybe 
we could drill down into that a little bit, what you're doing to drive your retention rates higher, and maybe 
how some of the  product bundling or suite strategy plays into that would be helpful as well. Thanks Amy.  
 
Amy Weaver  
 
Sarah, let me start by saying it's great to have you back as a covering analyst for our stock, and to hear 
your voice on this call.  
 
Yes, on attrition o r retention rates, really really pleased to see where we were this quarter. Again, record 
lows. I think it says so much about our teams who support that, but also our customers and their 
dedication to us, and the fact that Salesforce has become so mission -critical.  
 
I'm actually going to turn this over to Brian, because if there is an expert in the Company on attrition and 
what we're doing for our customers, it's Brian.  
 
Brian, do you want to add…  
 
Brian Millham  
 
Amy, thank you, I appreciate it. I'll quic kly address it. Thank you Sarah for the question.  
 
First of all, I think it's part of our heritage, our DNA, is that customer success is a core value of ours, and 
we own it across the entire Company. So it's not just the success teams or the services team s that own it, 
but the entire organization from product to our financial teams, everyone owns customer success.  
 
We've made some investments in the way that we go to market, touching our customers more frequently 
from a success perspective and the motions that we're running. As I mentioned earlier, selling products 
that align very specifically to our customers from the industry cloud perspective, and we're seeing better 
adoption rates there and better usage. We've also made some strategic investments in our  own services 
organization, alongside a great ecosystem of partners as well, that are driving better implementations up 
front, faster time to value for our customers, and better results from a customer success perspective. So, 
some of the motions that we'r e running that are new, great leadership under a gentleman named Jim 
Roth, who's running our success organization; Lori Steele, who joined us to run our services organization , 
and now has turned over the reins to Mark Wakelin, doing great work with our cus tomers, very oriented to 
speed to value and ensuring they're getting tremendous customer success on our platform.  
 
Mike Spencer  
 
Great, thanks Sarah .
